        <h4>Who is Benny Moré</h4>
        <p>Bartolomé Maximiliano Moré (24 August 1919 – 19 February 1963), known as Benny Moré, was a Cuban singer, bandleader and songwriter. Due to his fluid tenor voice and his great expressivity, he was known variously as El Bárbaro del Ritmo and El Sonero Mayor.[1] Moré was a master of most Cuban popular genres, such as the bolero, son montuno, mambo, and guaracha. Moré formed and led the Banda Gigante, one of the leading Cuban big bands of the 1950s, until his death in 1963...<button class="btn btn-link"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benny_Mor%C3%A9" target="_blank">Read More</a></button></p>
